\section{Formal requirements}

The report is structured for fair and efficient grading of over 100 individual projects in the space of only a few days. Please respect the exact structure of this document. You are allowed to remove sections 1 and 4. We expect that a good report will be \textbf{around $3$ pages} long. The hard limit for this report is 5 pages. 

It is recommended that you use this \LaTeX{} template, but you are allowed to reproduce it with the same structure in a WYSIWYG-editor. You should replace the blue text with your discussion. The questions we ask in blue are there to suggest which topics to discuss, rather than an exact list of questions that must be answered.

This report is a formative document and will not receive a grade. Naturally, it will be taken into account in our holistic assessment of the project. It will help you structure your group discussions, identify key issues, and get you started on implementing a performant evolutionary algorithm in the individual phase.
You will receive feedback on your list of identified issues from the teaching assistant.

This report should be uploaded to Toledo by \deadlineGroup. It must be in the \textbf{Portable Document Format} (pdf) and must be named \texttt{r0123456\_intermediate.pdf}, where r0123456 should be replaced with your student number. Each group member should hand it in individually on Toledo.


\section{An elementary evolutionary algorithm} 

\subsection{Representation}

\ReplaceMe{How do you represent the candidate solutions? What is your main motivation to choose this one? What other options did you consider? How did you implement this specifically in Python (e.g., a list, set, numpy array, etc)?}

\subsection{Initialization}

\ReplaceMe{How do you initialize the population? Did you consider advanced initialization mechanisms (local search operators, heuristic solutions)? Which ones did you implement? Do you believe your approach maintains sufficient diversity?}

\subsection{Selection operators}

\ReplaceMe{Which selection operators did you consider? If they are not from the slides, describe them. Which one did you implement? Can you motivate why you chose this one? Are there parameters that need to be chosen?}

\subsection{Mutation operator}

\ReplaceMe{Which mutation operators did you consider? If they are not from the slides, describe them. Which one did you implement? Why did you choose that one specifically? Do you believe it will introduce sufficient randomness? Can that be controlled with parameters? Do you use self-adaptivity?}

\subsection{Recombination operator}

\ReplaceMe{Which recombination operators did you consider? If they are not from the slides, describe them. Which one did you implement? Why did you choose that one specifically? Explain how you believe that this operator can produce offspring that combine the best features from their parents. How does your operator behave if there is little overlap between the parents? Can your recombination be controlled with parameters; what behavior do they change? Do you use self-adaptivity?}

\subsection{Elimination operators}

\ReplaceMe{Do you believe that $\lambda+\mu$-elimination is suitable for this project? Why? Did you consider other elimination schemes? What elimination scheme would you have preferred to implement? Why do you think that is more appropriate?} 

\subsection{Stopping criterion}

\ReplaceMe{When do you think the evolutionary algorithm should stop? Which stopping criterion did you implement? Did you combine several criteria?}

\subsection{Other considerations}

\ReplaceMe{Did you consider other items not listed above (e.g., local search operators, diversity preservations)? You can describe them here.}

\section{Numerical experiments}

\subsection{Chosen parameter values}

\ReplaceMe{What parameters are there to choose in your basic evolutionary algorithm? How did you approach parameter selection in this phase? Which are the parameters that you will use for the experiments below?}

\subsection{Preliminary results}

\ReplaceMe{Run your algorithm on the smallest benchmark problem. Include a convergence graph, by plotting the mean and best objective values in function of the time. How do you rate the performance of your algorithm (time, memory, speed of convergence, diversity of population, etc)? 

When you solve this problem several times, how much variation do you observe in the best solution? Include an informative plot of this.}

\subsection{List of identified issues}

\paragraph{Short description 1:} \ReplaceMe{Describe the observation or problem. Why do you think this is strange or problematic? Can you explain how it arises (e.g., the way the components interact with one another) What are possible solutions you can adopt?}

\section{Other comments}

\ReplaceMe{In case you think there is something important to discuss that is not covered by the previous sections, you can do it here.}
